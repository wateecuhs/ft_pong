# ft_pong

Platform to play ranked table tennis games on 42School campuses, using 42's Authentication and a chess-like elo system.

## Notes

This was my introduction to OAuth and authentications in general but also to websockets and databases (this is just using MongoDB so no "real" databases yet).

Didn't want to spend too much time on this so its a SPA with basic ui/ux.
I planned on doing tournaments and a proper matchmaking not just private rooms with codes but tbh its just more websockets implementations and i kinda got the gist of it (even though my implementation on this project probably sucks) and i had other stuff i wanted to do.
